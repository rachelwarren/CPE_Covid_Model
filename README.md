# Center for Policing Equity COVID-19 Modeling Project

We sought to simulate COVID-19 spread in a large, synthetic U.S. city, focusing on contributions of three domains in driving spread of COVID-19 and related racial disparities:
a)	low-wage, essential work, 
b)	police-public contact, and 
c)	jail and prison churn.

We used a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to illustrate the high level dynamics of the disease spread (rather than projecting precise case numbers in an actual city).

Please refer to the [Center for Policing Equity COVID-19 Modeling Project documentation](https://policingequity.org/what-we-do/research/covid-19-modeling-project) for further details about our modeling choices. 

## Directories

* **model**: Run our model in its entirety using Model.ipynb. Necessary functions for running the model can be found in python files also in this directory.
* **input**: Find the contact matrices and initial subpopulation group sizes as spreadsheets; these are necessary inputs into our model.

## Running The Code
The code notebook Model.ipynb can be run through jupyter notebooks. It is written in python3 and depends only on pandas, numpy and matplotilib.
